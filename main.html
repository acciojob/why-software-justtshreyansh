	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to be a developer because I genuinely enjoy solving problems and building things that have real-world impact. Development allows me to combine creativity with logicâ€”to take an idea and turn it into a functional product that others can use. I love the constant learning involved in this field; technology is always evolving, and that keeps me motivated and challenged. Most importantly, being a developer gives me a sense of ownership and satisfaction when I see something I created being used and appreciated.</p>
